<p>Hello! Today i wanted to start this blog, This blog is out of the love for Front End Web Development, I wanted to do this because i was inspired by what others have made, I have seen super cool blogs by people like Drew Devault, So why don't i try for myself?</p>
<p>My goal for this blog is just to have fun and maybe give people my input on certain topics such as Video Games, Writing, Linux, Hiking, Biking, Etc. I think i maybe want to post once every few mounths, Or whenever i feel like it, I don't really know what to start with. What i should say and if i can add anyhthing.</p>
<p>I am also very new to Front End Web Development, Working with html and css off and on for a good year, So I may want to try and get this Website up to code before i try to daily post onto it. As i do not want to deal with techicial debt in the future, I also want to find a nice content license to use for my site. The license so far are just placeholders, I even want to try to learn how to self-host the website on my own server instead of having to rely on Github, Which is owned and to my knowledge controlled by Microsoft. Which isn't ideal if i want this blog to be independed from big tech.</p>
