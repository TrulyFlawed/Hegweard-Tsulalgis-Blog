Hello! Today i wanted to start this blog, This blog is out of the love for Front End Web Development, I wanted to do this because i was inspired by what others have made, I have seen super cool blogs by people like Drew Devault, So why don't i try for myself?

My goal for this blog is just to have fun and maybe give people my input on certain topics such as Video Games, Writing, Linux, Hiking, Biking, Etc. I think i maybe want to post once every few mounths, Or whenever i feel like it, I don't really know what to start with. What i should say and if i can add anyhthing.

I am also very new to Front End Web Development, Working with html and css off and on for a good year, So I may want to try and get this Website up to code before i try to daily post onto it. As i do not want to deal with techicial debt in the future, I also want to find a nice content license to use for my site. The license so far are just placeholders, I even want to try to learn how to self-host the website on my own server instead of having to rely on Github, Which is owned and to my knowledge controlled by Microsoft. Which isn't ideal if i want this blog to be independed from big tech.
